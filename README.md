# Q-learning for Frozen Lake

This repository contains an implementation of the Q-learning algorithm to solve the Frozen Lake environment using the `gym` library. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing Q-learning from scratch.

## Project Structure

- `q_learning_frozen_lake.py`: Main script for training the Q-learning agent.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the repository.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

2. **Run the Training Script**:
python q_learning_frozen_lake.py

markdown
Copy code

3. **Evaluate the Agent**:
After training, the script evaluates the agent's performance and prints the success rate.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following key concepts of reinforcement learning:

- **Q-table Initialization**
- **Q-learning Update Rule**
- **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
- **Training and Evaluation of the Agent**
